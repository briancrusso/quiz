                <p>Although there are several choices on the web today to find out what kind of sandwich you are, this is the only quiz that really cares about who you are as a person, not just a sandwich. Still, it means a lot that you have chosen this quiz. We hope you'll find it as informative and arousing as your favorite protein or vegetable placed between two slices of bread....</p>
